A reproduction of the Wordle interface using HTML and CSS

# instructions

- Header / Keyboard / Game Board
  You should put the header at top, keyboard at bottom and the Game Board in the middle of the screen.

- Header
  You may just put the icons there, without content (i.e., nothing happens if you click on them).

The keyboards and the gameboard should resize nicely as in the game.

You may mock up two lines of guess history and show the animation at the third line.

Your mock up should include different colours (states) of the letters.
